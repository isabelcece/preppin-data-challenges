--For the Transaction Path table:
--Make sure field naming convention matches the other tables
--i.e. instead of Account_From it should be Account From
--For the Account Information table:
--Make sure there are no null values in the Account Holder ID
--Ensure there is one row per Account Holder ID
--Joint accounts will have 2 Account Holders, we want a row for each of them
--For the Account Holders table:
--Make sure the phone numbers start with 07
--Bring the tables together
--Filter out cancelled transactions 
--Filter to transactions greater than Â£1,000 in value 
--Filter out Platinum accounts
